- Check if sips and IM round the center position in the same way (floor|ceil)
  if the image dimensions are odds and if so, make the CI processor do the same.
- Why do we need autoload and actually make it work.
  Processor.processor_classes currently references them all, so they're simply
  loaded.
- Add Miso::Image#add(image, 10, 10), which adds another image on top of the
  image. This should be implemented by the processor as well.
- Add Miso::Image#watermark(image, :southwest, 10, 10), which uses
  Miso::Image#add to add an image in one of the corners.
- Right now the processors clear the operation buffer after writing, which
  means it's impossible to write out the same operations to multiple files.
