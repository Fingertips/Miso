(...) Miso

Miso is a unified API for simple image operations commonly used on the web. It
provides backends for often used graphic libraries, but it's also pretty easy
to plug in your own backend.

A unified API is helpful when you run your code on a number of different boxes
and architectures. For instance, you could develop your web application on your
Mac with the Core Image backend [1] and deploy to your Linux server with an
ImageMagick backend. You could even have the API talk to your custom
distributed image processing backend.

[1] Note how this means you will never have to install ImageMagick again (;


: EXAMPLES

Miso can be used in three different ways, each useful in different situations.

  1. For the quick crop
  
    Miso::Image.crop('input.jpg', 'output.jpg', 120, 100)
  
  2. For the elaborate business logic
  
    @image = Miso::Image.new('input.jpg')
    @image.crop(120, 100) if options[:crop]
    @image.fit(120, 100) if options[:fit]
    @image.write('output.jpg')
  
  3. As an option
  
    class Attachment
      has_variant :avatar,
        :processor => Miso::Image.factory.crop(120, 100).fit(60, 40)
    end
    
  Which works like this;
    
    factory = Miso::Image.factory.crop(123, 456)
    factory.apply('input.jpg', 'output.jpg')

But wait, there is more! Read the API documentation for more goodies.


: SUPPORTED BACKENDS

Currently supported backends are: Core Image and ImageMagick, because those
are the ones we use. If you want to contribute backends we're happy to
accept patches!
